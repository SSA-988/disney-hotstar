          <p>
            Where we refer to 'Personal Information' we mean any information
            related to a particular individual who we identify (whether directly
            or indirectly) a particular individual or natural person. This
            includes direct identifiers such as your name, postal address, email
            address, and mobile number, and also includes all other information
            which is linked to that information such as your location. Where we
            refer to "ID" we mean a list of numbers and/or letters (also known
            as a numeric or alphanumeric string) which we or our service
            providers may generate and which is used as a means to give you a
            unique customer or user identifier - it cannot directly identify
            personally but it may be able to do so where your Personal
            Information is associated with it.
